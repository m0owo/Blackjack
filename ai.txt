Heuristics: A heuristic is a strategy to estimate the "best" move without exhaustively searching all possible outcomes.
In Blackjack, heuristics can include:
-Dealer's current score.
-Number of remaining cards in the deck and their distribution.
-Player's visible card(s).
-Current round (e.g., early rounds favor conservative plays).

Search Problem: The dealer's decision (hit or stand) can be framed as a search problem:
State: Current hand and score of the dealer, visible player cards, and deck status.
Actions: "Hit" or "Stand."
Goal: Maximize the likelihood of winning without exceeding 21.

Evaluation Function: Used to evaluate the desirability of a given state or action. 
For example:
-Reward staying below or near 21.
-Penalize exceeding 21.
-Consider probability of better outcomes based on the deck composition.

Difficulty Levels:
Easy: Dealer hits on any score <17, ignoring heuristics.
Medium: Dealer considers simple heuristics (e.g., probability of busting based on current deck).
Hard: Dealer uses an advanced evaluation function incorporating game round, player hand, and deck composition.
